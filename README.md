Collaborative Writing
=============
This excercise was intended to demonstrate the routine used when working in a team on Git, namely git init
(for the person starting the repo)  or git clone (for the rest of the group), git pull (to get the latest file 
from the repo which obviously wasn't done for the first person), make changes then git add -all
, git commit -m "with comment" and git push origin master. 
This proved suprisingly difficult to accomplish. However, this skill was indespensable as we progressed in our 
work.
